# Data Engineering Project

The proposal is to create a pipeline that continuously extracts data from a public API, combines it with information extracted from a database, and places it into a Data Warehouse.

The chosen API is the Transport API, which provides dynamic and static GTFS information about buses, subways, and traffic within CABA (Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires). It includes information about parking and street closures.
